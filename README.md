## Featured Projects

### Time-Dependent Reaction-Diffusion PDE Solver

A comprehensive Python implementation of numerical solvers for reaction-diffusion systems. This project demonstrates advanced finite difference methods for solving time-dependent PDEs that arise in:

- **Pattern Formation**: Gray-Scott model, Turing patterns
- **Population Dynamics**: Fisher's equation, invasion waves
- **Excitable Media**: FitzHugh-Nagumo model, neuronal activity
- **Chemical Oscillators**: Brusselator, Schnakenberg models

**Key Features:**
- Multiple boundary conditions (periodic, Neumann, Dirichlet)
- Comprehensive visualization tools (animations, phase space, power spectra)
- 4 classic models with detailed examples
- Stability analysis and parameter exploration

See [REACTION_DIFFUSION_README.md](REACTION_DIFFUSION_README.md) for full documentation.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python quick_test.py           # Verify installation
python example_gray_scott.py   # Run Gray-Scott simulation
```
